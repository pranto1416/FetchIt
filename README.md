This game was created during industrial training session, a lot of things left incomplete, so we wouldn't recommend you to blindly follow this repository and copy paste everything we did there.
Game development is a fun and iterative process, requires patience and time, try to use your own creativity and use this repository as a skeleton where you should add the skin and flesh for your final project.

All the best for your final Game Jam! Good Luck!
