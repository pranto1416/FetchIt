Dear Game Jam Participants,

Welcome to the exciting world of game development!! 
We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey as you embark on creating your very first game. It's a significant milestone, and we applaud your enthusiasm and dedication to learning and growing in this creative field.
Remember, your first game is a special experience—it's where you lay the foundation for many more exciting projects ahead.

This repository was born during our industrial training classes, where we poured our hearts into its creation. While there are still many elements awaiting completion, we advise against simply copying this repository.

Game development is an incredibly rewarding and iterative process that thrives on creativity, patience, and time. We encourage you to infuse your own ideas and creativity. Think of this repository as a sturdy framework—ready for you to add the finishing touches that will make your final project truly shine.

We believe in your abilities and dedication. Enjoy every moment of this experience, and may your efforts in the Game Jam be met with success and fulfillment.

Best of luck!
